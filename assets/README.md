Place your profile photo in this folder and name it `profile.jpg`.

Recommended steps:
1. Save the attached photo as `profile.jpg`.
2. Place it in the `assets` folder.
3. The site will automatically use `assets/profile.jpg` as the headshot. If the file is missing, a placeholder image is used instead.

Image sizing: the page uses CSS classes to display the image at 160x160 on small screens and 224x224 on medium+ screens; you can replace it with a higher-resolution image for sharper display on large devices.
